**Description :** Welcome aboard ! In this group project I did in the course of airport management, we focused on the evolution, analysis of London Heathrow Airport (LHR) within the context of the aviation industry, a subject in which I have a strong passion. Our study investigated the growth patterns of passenger traffic at LHR, both pre- and post-COVID, utilizing **Excel** to analyze the data and generate visual representations through graphs. We further explored the airport's top connections, categorizing them by their contribution to the continents and years, and conducted a comparative analysis of these connections among other London airports. Our research then shifted to defining the strategic objectives of LHR, including runway and terminal expansion, while assessing the potential environmental impacts of such development. In response to these concerns, we proposed data-driven action plans aimed at mitigating CO2 emissions and promoting sustainable growth in the aviation sector.<br>
