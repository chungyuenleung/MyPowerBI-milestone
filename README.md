## PowerBI project

### Power BI dashboards on Airbnb listing in ten European cities

**Description:** This project aims to analyze Airbnb data from 10 popular European destinations using **Power BI** and **Python**. utilizing advanced techniques such as **DAX and correlation plots**. The analysis focuses on price allocation across the cities, the relationship between prices and factors such as being a superhost or weekdays/weekends, and factors contributing to qualifying for superhost status. The location of the listing, proximity to metro/city center, and capacity for hosting are also considered.<br>
**Methodology:** The data is extracted from Kaggle, and EDA is performed using Python. Data cleaning and transformation are also done in Python, after which the data is visualized in Power BI using various chart such ascorrelation plots and GIS maps. DAX is used to form the correlation plot which analyze the data and gain insights into the factors influencing Airbnb prices.<br>
**Suggestion and result:** The analysis shows that Amsterdam and Paris are the most expensive cities for Airbnb listings, and being a superhost does not necessarily result in higher prices. The location of the listing, its capacity for hosting, and its cleanliness rating and guest satisfaction are important factors influencing prices.<br>
**Improvement:** Further improvement can be made by finding a larger dataset to confirm whether superhosts have a lower average price or whether is because this dataset has many outliers. Occupancy rates per month and throughout the year can also be added as to conduct factor analysis regarding the popularity of Airbnb listings. Additionally, seasonal events may affect prices, and these periods need to be excluded from the analysis for certain cities. The constraints of the project include limited data and the need for more comprehensive datasets to improve the accuracy of the analysis.<br>
