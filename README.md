## PowerBI project

### Power BI dashboards on Airbnb listing in ten European cities


**Description:** This project aims to analyze Airbnb data from 10 popular European destinations using **Power BI** and **Python**. utilizing advanced techniques such as **DAX and correlation plots**. The analysis focuses on price allocation across the cities, the relationship between prices and factors such as being a superhost or weekdays/weekends, and factors contributing to qualifying for superhost status. The location of the listing, proximity to metro/city center, and capacity for hosting are also considered.<br>
**Suggestion and result:**<br>

1.Amsterdam and Paris are the most expensive european cities for Airbnb listings.<br> 
2.Price do not have a positive relationship with superhost status<br>
3.However, location, capacities, rating of the listings have a positive relationship with price<br>
**Improvement:**<br>

1.Find a larger dataset to determine whether the superhost has a relationship with price or it is because of outliers<br>
2.Find a dataset with occupancy rate by month, year to analysis user perfenrence on airBnb listing and its popularity factor<br>
3.Exclude seasonal event period which might cause price fluctation<br>
